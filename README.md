# Made4Living Website

This is the source code for the Made4Living website. The website is a showcase of our architectural designs and 3D models.

## Technology Stack

The website is built using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language used for the website's functionality.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **GLTF:** A runtime asset format for 3D scenes and models using the JSON standard.
- **Netlify Functions:** Serverless functions used for handling backend logic.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the main source code for the website. It includes the main App component, as well as various other components used throughout the website.
- `public/`: This directory contains static files served by the website, including 3D models and the site's HTML entry point.
- `netlify/`: This directory contains Netlify serverless functions and related schemas.
- `img/`: This directory contains image assets used in the website.

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once you have those, you can install the project's dependencies and start the development server:

```sh
npm install
npm start

This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000.
