The renovation included meticulous restoration and reuse of the beautiful marble flooring and particular attention to bespoke bookshelving, which added an elegant touch to the overall design, separating the entrance to the living space whilst allowing natural light to penetrate. The outdoor garden was also transformed into a stunning oasis that complements the interior design of the space.
