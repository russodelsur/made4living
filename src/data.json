    "body": "The project involved a complete internal renovation of a ground floor apartment located in the San Saba neighborhood in the center of Rome. The renovation included meticulous restoration and reuse of the beautiful marble flooring and particular attention to bespoke bookshelving, which added an elegant touch to the overall design, separating the entrance to the living space whilst allowing natural light to penetrate. The outdoor garden was also transformed into a stunning oasis that complements the interior design of the space. The end result was a stunning transformation of the apartment that added an extra bathroom and two walk-in closets.",
